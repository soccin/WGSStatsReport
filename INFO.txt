For Whole Genome Sequencing ,  I create 4 spreadsheets :
1-      WGS: contains field from the WGS file and the MD file
                From WGS file:
GENOME_TERRITORY
MEAN_COVERAGE
SD_COVERAGE
MEDIAN_COVERAGE
MAD_COVERAGE
PCT_EXC_MAPQ
PCT_EXC_DUPE
PCT_EXC_UNPAIRED
PCT_EXC_BASEQ
PCT_EXC_OVERLAP
PCT_EXC_CAPPED
PCT_EXC_TOTAL
PCT_5X
PCT_10X
PCT_15X
PCT_20X
PCT_25X
PCT_30X
PCT_40X
PCT_50X
PCT_60X
PCT_70X
PCT_80X
PCT_90X
PCT_100X
From MD file:
UNPAIRED_READS_EXAMINED
READ_PAIRS_EXAMINED
UNMAPPED_READS
UNPAIRED_READ_DUPLICATES
READ_PAIR_DUPLICATES
READ_PAIR_OPTICAL_DUPLICATES
PERCENT_DUPLICATION
ESTIMATED_LIBRARY_SIZE
 
2-      OxoG file
I am reporting the Oxidation_Q for each sample, in the different context:
CCA
ACC
CCC
GCA
TCT
ACG
CCG
GCC
GCG
ACT
TCA
CCT
TCC
GCT
TCG
ACA
 
3-      Median INsertSize
4-       
MEDIAN_INSERT_SIZE
MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION
MIN_INSERT_SIZE
MAX_INSERT_SIZE
MEAN_INSERT_SIZE
STANDARD_DEVIATION
READ_PAIRS
 
5-      GCBias
I inspect the graphs, no value reported.
 
 
Thanks again!
